## Getting Started

1. Create your blog repository:
    - [Generate a new repository](https://github.com/iyanarmanda/fumika/generate) from this template or fork this repository.
    - Or run one of the following commands (*soon*):
       ```sh
       npm create fumika@latest
       yarn create fumika
       pnpm create fumika@latest
       bun create fumika@latest
       deno run -A npm:create-fumika@latest
       ```
2. To edit your blog locally, clone your repository, run `pnpm install` to install dependencies.
    - Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) `npm install -g pnpm` if you haven't.
3. Edit the config file `src/config.ts` to customize your blog.
4. Run `pnpm new-post <filename>` to create a new post and edit it in `src/content/posts/`.
5. Deploy your blog to Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc. following [the guides](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/). You need to edit the site configuration in `astro.config.mjs` before deployment.
